#  Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

#10 min google

two 25 min blocks

# 10 google to find good resources

# spend 20 mins with best resource

break
#

spend 20 with next resource

add more time as needed


# After googling for good resources, I ended up using the W3 tutorial, and did two 25 minute sessions reading and doing the exercizes. I felt that I wasn't incorporating the knowlege, so I moved over to Code Academy and spent an hour there going through the Jquery intros.
