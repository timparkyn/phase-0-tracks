#	What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

###	Well, the first thing I learned is that people have spent many, many hours deliberating about linux design philosophy. I could spend many hours reading and not answer this question well. Some od the key concepts are keeping things small and portable, and giving the user full power over the os.



#In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

###	Essentially you're buying space on a huge server farm to run your own server. You get the benefits of all the maintained infrastucture without the hassles (hopefully). 



#Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

### Because you can do bad things there. Since Linux is a hierachical multi-user system, the root area has access to all of the key operating system code, and can easily delete or change files, and potentially kill the system.
