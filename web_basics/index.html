	<h1>I don't like bike racing</h1>
	<strong>Seriously.</strong>
	<em>I mean it.</em>
	<p>
	<p>Back in the day, racing was cooler because</p>
	<ol>
		<li>They made beer stops</li>
		<li>They made wine stops</li>
		<li>And took simplier drugs</li>
	</ol>
   <p>And now they</p>
   <ul>
		<li>prance around</li>
		<li>in tight outfits</li>
		<li>as corporate billboards</li>
  </ul>
	<p>But they do have cool crashes</p>
