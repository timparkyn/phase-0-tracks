# Release 4 reflections ------------------------------

# What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?
## Especially in a pairing scenario, pseudocoding was very helpful in providing a mental roadmap of what we needed to do. Since we both had an understanding, less instruction was needed from navigator to driver.

# What are the tradeoffs of using arrays and hashes for this challenge?
## Arrays are simplier and easier to access. But in this case, the hash was easier as we were tracking unique items. 

# What does a method return?
## the value of the last statement

# What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments?
## variables, strings, and numbers

# How can you pass information between methods?
## by putting methods in a class. Also methods can be used inside of methods.

# What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?
## This challenge helped me to better understand the use of hashes and of using block statements.
